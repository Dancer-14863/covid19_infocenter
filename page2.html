                                                COVAXIN®, India's indigenous COVID-19 vaccine by way of Bharat Biotech
                                                is developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical
                                                Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV).

                                                The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in
                                                Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) excessive containment
                                                facility.

                                                The vaccine is developed the use of Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell
                                                derived platform technology. Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and
                                                are therefore not going to revert and purpose pathological effects. They
                                                contain lifeless virus, incapable of infecting people however still
                                                capable to coach the immune machine to mount a defensive reaction in
                                                opposition to an infection.</p>

                                                know-how to increase inactivated vaccines with a safe music record of
                                                >300 million doses of resources to date. It is the well-established, and
