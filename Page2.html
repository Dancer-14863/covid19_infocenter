COVAXIN®, India's indigenous COVID-19 vaccine by way of Bharat Biotech is developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV).

The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) excessive containment facility.

The vaccine is developed the use of Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell derived platform technology. Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and are therefore not going to revert and purpose pathological effects. They contain lifeless virus, incapable of infecting people however still capable to coach the immune machine to mount a defensive reaction in opposition to an infection.</p>

Why strengthen Inactivated Vaccine? <br><br>
Conventionally, inactivated vaccines have been around for decades. Numerous vaccines for ailments such as Seasonal Influenza, Polio, Pertussis, Rabies, and Japanese Encephalitis use the equal technological know-how to increase inactivated vaccines with a safe music record of >300 million doses of resources to date. It is the well-established, and time-tested platform in the world of vaccine technology.</p>
